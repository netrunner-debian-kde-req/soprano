Description: Qt interface to RDF storage
 Soprano (formally known as QRDF) is a library which provides a nice Qt 
 interface to RDF storage solutions. It has a modular structure which 
 allows to replace the actual RDF storage implementation used.
 .
 Currently Soprano implements one fully functional backend which is based
 on librdf, the Redland RDF Application Framework.
 .
 This package contains the runtime library files needed to run software
 using libsoprano.
